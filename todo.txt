Automatic subscriptions:
- when you are assigned to a task
- if you created an org or a board
- if you sent a collaboration request

- Accepted collaborators take lowest from public by default
- Some resource types require more work on their permissions
chat, comment (delete and update only if I created it), 
subscription (should I be able to remove someone else?)
I think we can solve some by adding specific permissions, and others
by letting the item itself be it's own permission provider, but then
it's permission won't be updateable from  it's parent? or
just make special accomodations for them

- How do we group notifications
- User read counter or individual notifications
- Jobs ( email & notifications grouping & sending )
- Notifications template functions
- Resolve notification attachements or annotations or resources?
- Cache some notifications before sending them out, so as to group them
- Time sensitive vs non-time sensitive notifications
- pagination & new counts

- 2 types of subscriptions, on resource, and on authoritative parent
- prevent too many notifications, like if I created a board
- delete all mark deleted blocks
- delete all the audit logs & pause logs in code

// TODO: drop older models and collections

- Text search & indexing, elastic search
- File upload
- How many dynos do I have with our subscription on Heroku
- Payment
- dueAt - your date, and dueAt duration + or -

Subscription edge cases
- when comments in a task are updated, let user know
