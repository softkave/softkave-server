Relatively simple work items:
- Run cron jobs to remove tokens and clients not used after 2 months
- Browser notifications should be shown in 2 ways. First is when the user is logged in, 
  but not viewing the chat room. A notification should show the name of the person or the room, 
  and the message. If the user is currently not active, then we'd show a browser-level notification.
