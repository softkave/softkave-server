Sprint Implementation

Idea :-
Sprints are for grouping tasks to be worked on within a time duration.

How will it work :-
1. In a board, if sprints aren't set up yet, the user'll have to set them up first with a duration 
which is the amount of time from the start date a sprint should run for.
2. In the Sprints page ( inside boards ), a user can create multiple consecutive sprints
( that is, the next sprint created will take place after the one before it ), add tasks to them 
( except past sprints ), and delete them, but cannot delete past or the current running sprint.
3. A user can start a sprint if there isn't one running yet, and only the next sprint in the list 
can be started, and then the next once that one is completed, and so on. Once started, the sprint will 
run for the duration defined in the sprint setup.
4. The current sprint can be ended early, just in time, or late, but once ended, cannot be started again. 
Once ended, if there are tasks in the sprint not completed yet, they'll roll over to the next sprint.

How to setup sprints :-
1. In the board, there'll be a button to setup sprint if not setup yet, OR maybe a sprints page, with a 
setup sprints button if not setup yet.
2. Sprint duration is the only required value needed. The user can also decide to automate the naming 
of sprints, or should be done manually with suggestion.
3. Once setup, users can add sprints, and work on and with them.

Sprint name generation :-
Every sprint has a start date, an end date, a start year ( the year is either expected to start or the 
year it was started ), an end year ( same with start year, but relating to it's end ), it's index in 
the overall sprints count, and it's number in the sprints starting that year.
